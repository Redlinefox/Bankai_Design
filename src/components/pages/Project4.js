          In the Spring of 2020 I was enrolled in SMU's User Experience design
          course as part of my UX Design certification. My instructors broke us out into teams
          and we set to work on building a new application. This is an overview of our process.

              After brainstorming over various common user problems we as a team decided to
              tackle issues surrounding gift giving.

              During our contextual research phase we learned that gift giving is a pretty
              sticky topic baked with plenty of pain points and complexity.
              Gift giving is as old as mankind itself and it is rooted in socioeconomics
              and many cultures across the globe.

          <div className='project-text-center'>
            <p>
              With these identified pain points we moved to an exploratory phase with in-depth
              interviews asking questions around peoples’ experiences receiving and giving gifts.&nbsp;
              We identified three major insights:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>End users talked about how affordability and reach play an important role when giving a gift</li>
              <li>Handmade or tailored gifts for a person generates emotion, making the gift not just a gift, but a memorable occasion.</li>
              <li>It is not only about the gift, but the experience of unwrapping, and the surprise behind it.</li>
            </ol>

              Our surveys helped us validate that people would consider sending and receiving a
              gift through a virtual platform. As we developed our target market, we wanted
              to make sure to also assess extreme users, and that our app could be used by people of
              all ages.

              Our typical user persona might be a Gen Z, like ASHLEY; she is an early adopter of
              technology, a heavy social media user that understands privacy, and prefers less
              materialistic items.

              At the beginning we were trying to address a pain point that we thought was going to be
              resolved with a Concierge-type app that would help you find your perfect gift.
              But as we explored deeper, and in light of Covid-19, we decided that our
              app had a bigger purpose. Our app had the ability to thrive in what many
              consider to be the “new norm”: the effectiveness of virtual items.

              We designed an app that facilitates the creation of gifts through music, photos,
              and videos, and offer a bundled package to send combinations of any three. Gifts
              created on the app can be shared to public feeds. This assists other users in
              ideation, a major pain point derived from research. A team of designers would
              grow a library of download-able gift packages to also assist in the creation of gifts.

              Competitors analysis was done and apps were measured in terms of virtual exchanges,
              and the intent of gift giving, which we believe is what makes our app competitive.
              UnWrapped follows a Freemium model, a free app with premium add-ons, at a
              cost. This could be special downloadable packages from our designers, such as AR
              add-ons, or branded packages from business partnerships.

              Due to the limited time we had, we wanted to cover as much ground as possible so we
              used  the R-I-T-E method; Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation.  Our goal was
              to keep the questions intentionally open-ended, collect feedback, evaluate quickly and
              then re-design the biggest pains.

              We did a moderated test using Zoom to watch the Users and gave them AdobeXD's User
              Testing link to access the interactive mobile app.  We recorded the test, listened
              to the User commentary, watched where the User was going and what they were clicking on.
              <br /><br />After each user test was done we focused mostly on qualitative questions, like “I noticed it took you a bit longer to find the Navigation bar.  Can you tell me why?” and then get their feedback.  We incorporated some A/B Testing at the end to compare which designs worked better.

              In the Login screen, a common issue we noticed with users is that they would not
              see the Sign Up at the bottom and just jump straight into the Login.  It would
              get skimmed over and did not grab the attention of the user.  <br /><br />With the re-design,
              we wanted to keep the sign up button consistent with the log-in, yet more prominent
              than before, while maintaining visual distance.

              Many users were not able to make a connection that the 3 box design was meant to
              signal a Bundle combination.<br /><br />We decided to integrate a graphic equation in
              onboarding showing that the Bundle is a combination of three mediums, and re-worded
              the description using color coding. In light of directing the experience,
              we also gave hierarchy to the NEXT, over the SKIP, button.

              When users were tasked with Creating and Sharing a Gift they ran into issues with
              finding the Creation button that was tucked in the navigation slide down.<br /><br />
              While we challenged a design mashup of profile and navigation, this hid the most
              important function. We replaced the floating search button with Create, giving it
              prominence from the home feeds and moved the search to the top.<br /><br />
              Taking note of the proximity principle, we also enlarged the slide down symbol to give
              it more emphasis.

              In the end we learned more about our users and acquired a deeper empathy for the
              frustrations they had with our application.  Ultimately it allowed us to restructure
              the mental models of the design thus creating a more meaningful and user-friendly
                product!<br /><br />While our marketing audience focused on Gen Z, this app is for everybody and anybody that wants to send a gift!

              Our contextual research taught us that gift giving is as old as humankind, but we believe
              there’s an opportunity to re-imagine what it might look like as we adjust to a
              “new normal” in light of COVID-19.
                <br /><br />But what does the business of virtual giving look like?
                <br /><br />Perhaps it’s a “freemium model", or maybe potential opportunity for
                partnerships with platforms like Spotify and Youtube for music and video gifts.
                <br /><br />While we would love to tell you that this is the final product, we know better
                than that now! We have a hunch that there are certain next steps we would need to validate. So if we were to continue moving forward, we would take a deeper dive into user expectations.
