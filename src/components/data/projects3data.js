Debates within our group happened and we had to confer with C-Hear and other sources to get feedback.  We ended up merging ideas and these led to the Echo-chain!"

Collectible digital merchandise is a growing industry and there is little to no representation for artists in this field. \n\n Businesses have already started breaking into the digital collectibles field using block-chain technology. The target demographic would be Gen Z and Millennials as market studies show they take the most interest in this type of media."

There might even be a personal message from the musician to end-user. \n\n If advanced upon, we would add more design details, get user feedback via A/B testing and reiterate it until we received a satisfactory “Wow” from market testers."
